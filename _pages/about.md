👋 Hi, I’m Pooja

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about turning data into real-world, production-ready AI systems. With a Master's in Data Science and hands-on experience across the full ML lifecycle, I love building systems that bridge research and deployment, from model design to large-scale orchestration.

Over the past year, I’ve:
	•	🚀 Designed and deployed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for semantic product search using OpenAI LLMs, Pinecone, and Snowflake.
	•	🎨 Fine-tuned Stable Diffusion with LoRA for domain-specific image generation, evaluated with CLIP similarity.
	•	🧠 Built scalable ML APIs with FastAPI, Docker, and Kubernetes, powering real-time inference and data workflows.

My current interests lie in generative AI, LLM systems, and MLOps — especially optimizing model serving, monitoring, and retraining pipelines.
When I’m not coding, you’ll find me reading fiction, watching reality shows, or diving into the latest AI research breakthroughs.
