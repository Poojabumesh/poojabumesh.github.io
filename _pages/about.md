Hi, I'm **Pooja**, a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about turning data into impactful, production-ready AI solutions. With a Master's in Data Science and hands-on experience fine-tuning diffusion models, building recommendation systems, and orchestrating MLOps pipelines, I love tackling challenges at every stage of the ML lifecycle—from data collection and feature engineering to model deployment and monitoring.

Over the past year, I’ve:
- Designed and deployed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system for wine product search using vector embeddings, OpenAI LLMs, and Pinecone.  
- Fine-tuned Stable Diffusion with LoRA for domain-specific image generation and evaluated results with CLIP similarity.  
- Built scalable ML APIs with FastAPI, Docker, and Kubernetes, integrating models into real-time applications.  

My core interests include **deep learning**, **generative AI**, **system design**, and **MLOps**. When I’m not coding, I’m reading fictions, watching reality shows, or exploring the latest advancements in AI research.
